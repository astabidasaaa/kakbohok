Better explain what it does here: It configures your local repo to ignore the (likely globally) configured `credential.helper`, e.g. the Windows credential store. This also means it asks for a username/password *each time* it needs it, as nothing is configured, So maybe you can also configure the `credential.helper` to cache instead (see @Ciro Santilli's answer) or use a different answer here.

Although, previous solution will keep you pushing as yourself, but it will allow you to push into her repo. If you don't want this and work in different folder on the same pc, you can setup username and email locally inside a folder with git by removing `-g` flag of the config command:

Many young designers often misunderstand the concept of web design, web design is about design, not about coding and front-end development. Of course, it would be great if you know some coding language (HTML, CSS, Java), but you can’t get yourself deep into front-end development, that’s not the core of web design. Web design is to solve the communication problems between users and web page information.
